    "\n",
    "2.Speech Recognition: While using Google, we get an option of Search by voice, it comes under speech recognition, and it's a popular application of Machine Learning. Speech recognition is a process of converting voice instructions into text, and it is also known as Speech to text, or Computer based speech recognition At present, machine learning algorithms are widely used by various applications of speech recognition. Google assistant, Siri, Cortana, and Alexa are using speech recognition technology to follow the voice instructions.\n",
